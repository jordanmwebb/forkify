#### Culinary app that allows users to search for recipes, add items to their grocery list, and save dishes to their favorites.

### Functionality
This project was built using Vanilla **JavaScript**. The search functionality communicates with the **Food2Fork API** to deliver a list of recipes associated with a user's search. Users can add recipes from a search result to their grocery list, delete any items they may already have, and change the quantity of each ingredient depending on their need. Any recipe can be saved to a user's favorites and will persist even after a page refresh.
